					CAREFULLY READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT BEFORE YOU CHECK THE BOX INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. BY CHECKING THE BOX OR USING THE WEBSITE IN ANY MANNER, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT.

				</p>
				<p>
					<b>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS; LEGAL COMPLIANCE</b><br>
					Ranger Studio LLC, a New York limited liability company (hereinafter referred to as “Directus”, “we”, “our” or “us”), provides this website (the “Site”), including all information, documents, communications, files, images, text, graphics, software, software applications, and products available through the Site (collectively, the “Materials”) and all services offered or operated by Directus and third parties through the Site, including all content management services offered by Directus, (collectively, the “Services”), available for your use subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this document and any changes to this document that we may publish from time to time (collectively, the “Terms of Use” or “Agreement”).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>2. OPEN SOURCE ELEMENTS SUBJECT TO GNU (VERSION 3) LICENSE</b><br>
					Except for Materials and Services requiring registration of an Account on the Site, software and services on the Site which do not require registration or an Account are provided for free as open source software, which shall be governed by GNU General Public License (Version 3) to the extent that those terms conflict with the terms of this Agreement. The GNU License is accessible at: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>3. MODIFICATION; AMENDMENTS</b><br>
					We reserve the right to change the Terms of Use and other guidelines, fees or rules posted on the Site from time to time at our sole discretion. Your continued use of the Site, or any Materials or Services accessible through it, after such notice has been posted constitutes your acceptance of the changes. Your use of the Site will be subject to the most current version of the Terms of Use, rules and guidelines posted on the Site at the time of such use. You should periodically check these Terms of Use to view the then current terms. If you breach any of the Terms of Use, your authorization to use this Site automatically terminates.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>4. AGREEMENT TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAW</b><br>
					In using the Directus Materials or Services, you agree to comply with all applicable domestic and international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations regarding your use of the Site, the Materials or Services.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>5. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION</b><br>
					As a condition to your use of the Materials and Services provided by Directus you will be required to register for a user account (an “Account”) on the Site, following the account registration directions provided on the Site. There is no fee for merely maintaining a Directus Account.
				</p>
				<p>
					By using the Site and/or setting up an Account you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving our Materials and Services under applicable laws. You also agree:
				</p>
				<p>
					<ol type="i">
						<li>that you will supply only complete and accurate information in registering for an Account;</li>
						<li>that you are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, that you will keep your Account password secure at all times, and that we will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your Account; and</li>
						<li>that if your Account has been compromised for any reason, you will immediately notify us of the security breach or unauthorized use of your Account.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					We reserve the right to (a) take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in our sole discretion, violates these Terms of Use; (b) in our sole discretion without notice and without limitation or liability, refuse, restrict access to or availability of, or terminate any user’s Account for any violation of this Agreement or your violation of any of our rules or policies. A termination of your Account will also terminate all of your database Instances, as defined below.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>6. DATABASE INSTANCES; SERVICE PLANS</b><br>
					After you have registered for a user Account, you will be able to purchase service plans for a single or multiple database instances (each database instance, an “Instance” and collectively, “Instances”). You may subscribe for a single Instance or for multiple Instances, and each Instance is treated separately for subscription and termination purposes. For each Instance you will be required to select your service plan and make applicable payments, as directed on the Site. Directus offers several service plans for each Instance, with varying monthly subscription fees, as described in more detail on the Site.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you subscribe for an Instance or Instances, you will be required to provide us with billing and account information for credit card, debit or other payment systems (each a “Payment Source”) for which you are authorized to approve charges. You authorize us to automatically and immediately bill the Payment Source when payments for subscription plans are due. The billing of all subscription service plans is made on a pre-paid basis. Each Instance subscribed for will have its own billing cycle and will be invoiced separately. Unless expressly provided otherwise on the Site, all payments and amounts are in United States Dollars.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may amend and make changes to our service plans and to corresponding subscription fees at any time upon notice to you, and such changes shall take effects at the commencement of the next billing cycle for the subscription of each Instance unless you such Instance(s) prior to the next corresponding billing cycle. If applicable, we will charge you sales tax in addition to our subscription fee for each subscribed Instance, as required by law.
				</p>
				<p>
					By selecting a particular plan, you represent to Directus that your proposed use for such Instance falls within the parameters described under your selected service plan. For example, if a selected plan is limited to 3 users, you agree that only 3 users will make use of the subscribed Instance, and you agree to upgrade your plan if additional users are added.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>7. FREE TRIALS</b><br>
					For some of our service plans we may offer users a free trial period. Such free trials are provided at our sole discretion and we may discontinue such offering at any time without notice to you. To utilize a free trial, you will be required to register for an Account, in the same manner as is required for all other subscriptions. You will also be required to provide payment information. Unless provided otherwise on the Site, the trial period is 14 days. If you fail to terminate the subscription for the particular Instance prior to the expiration of the 14-day period we will, and you authorize us to, automatically charge your Payment Source the monthly subscription fee for the selected service plan/Instance(s). Unless you terminate the subscription, the subscription for the Instance(s) will automatically renew on a monthly basis (pursuant to Section 6 below) and you will be charged automatically upon each renewal.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>8. AUTOMATIC RENEWALS</b><br>
					Directus offers monthly subscriptions and may also offer annual subscriptions. Unless terminated pursuant to this Agreement, the subscription term for each Instance will renew automatically at the end of the paid-for term for the same period as the original subscription term for the particular Instance. For example, if you subscribe for one Instance on a monthly subscription, then, unless terminated, the subscription for that Instance will renew automatically for additional month-long periods at the end of each successive month.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>9. CANCELLATION OF INSTANCES; TERMINATION OF ACCOUNT</b><br>
					You may, at any time, terminate any of Instances for which you subscribed by going to the “Instance Dashboard” and selecting “Destroy Instance,” thereby discontinuing any future automatic renewal for that particular Instance. Because each Instance is a stand-alone subscription, you may terminate some or all of your Instance subscriptions in this manner. No refunds will be made for unused portions of subscription periods.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may also terminate your entire Account by making the appropriate selection on your Account dashboard. Deleting an Account has the effect of deleting all Instances under the Account. No refunds will be made for unused portions of subscription periods.
				</p>

				<h2 class="margin-b-60"><b>Privacy Policy</b></h2>

				<p>
					This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for this website and various related services (together referred to as the “Site”). We are committed to protecting your privacy online and to conducting ourselves transparently. Accordingly, please read the information below to learn the following regarding your use of this Site, the information we collect from you and how we use that information:
				</p>
				<p>
					You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our Site Terms and Conditions, and by accessing or using our Site, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use this Site.
				</p>
				<p>
					We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to issuing an email to the email address listed by registered users or posting the revised policy on this page. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid email address as a registered user of the Site, review this Site and this policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site after such modifications will constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of the modified policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the modified policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>1. What information do we collect from you?</b><br>
				In order to better provide you with our services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our Site.
				</p>
				<p>
					Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are, such as (without limitation) your name, email address and payment information. For example, when you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering for an account on the Site to subscribe for Database Instances, we will ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include, for example (and without limitation), the Site’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from, which URL you go to next, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>2. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</b><br>
					We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you register for an account.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, we may also collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Site and to gather demographic information.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices, such as account status and billing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>3. With whom do we share your information?</b><br>
					We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others. We may utilize the services of third parties and provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners and other third parties, and to facilitate such arrangements we reserve the right to share with such third parties Personally Identifiable Information, provided that such third party agree to not share the information. We and our service providers and partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our Sites and to deliver products and services.
				</p>
				<p>
					Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers’ traffic patterns, and related Site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include Personally Identifiable Information.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>4. Changes to Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br>
					We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information (especially your email address) if it changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>5. What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?</b><br>
					We may, from time to time, send you email regarding updates to our website and services or about the services of affiliates or marketing/advertising partners. You may unsubscribe from receiving promotional communications by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in such email communication.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>6. What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</b><br>
					At our Site you can be assured that your Personally Identifiable Information is secure, consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. Your Personally Identifiable Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Personally Identifiable Information is available through a password and unique user ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to via password. We encrypt your Personally Identifiable Information and thereby prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us.
				</p>
				<p>
					We utilize data storage provided by reputable third parties, and all data included under your subscribed Instances will be stored by such third parties and will constitute Personally Identifiable Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>7. Do we use “cookies”?</b><br>
					When you use our Site we may store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. The cookies make your use of the Site easier, make the Site run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our Site may not work properly in that case.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>8. What should you know about privacy policies and data collection at any third party sites accessible from our Site?</b><br>
					Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other sites accessible through our Site, if any, have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site’s privacy policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>9. What else should you know about your privacy online?</b><br>
					If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this Site, or your dealings with this Site, please contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@directus.io">info@directus.io</a>.
